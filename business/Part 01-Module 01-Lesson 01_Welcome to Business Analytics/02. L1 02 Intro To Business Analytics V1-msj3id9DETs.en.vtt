00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
It's no surprise that businesses need to

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.690
compete to gain share of their markets, and stay relevant.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.570
However, it may be surprising to learn that data and business analysts,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.960
play an increasingly important role in this competition.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.105
How are market trends shifting?

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.565
What are new innovations for investment?

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:23.505
How are customers reacting to our products?

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.980
How do we make product improvements?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220
Or what are our forecasted sales into the next quarter?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.465
These are a handful of questions that business analysts aim to answer by using data.

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:40.085
These analysts frequently need foundational skills in statistics,

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:43.735
Excel and SQL as well as data visualization,

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:48.950
to make the decisions that are most impactful at improving business metrics.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.915
In this course, you'll become familiar with these tools,

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.720
and the skills needed to become a business analyst.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.780
See the complete overview of topics in your classroom,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.375
and I'll see you later on in the program,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.360
as we dive into each of these topics.
