00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
We know it's important to show off what you've accomplished in the classroom.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.620
The projects you'll complete are designed to highlight

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.655
mastery and the skills that companies around the globe are looking for.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.355
In the first project,

00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:17.220
you have your chance to draw conclusions using data dashboards.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040
By the end of the program,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.825
you'll be able to build your very own dashboards just like the ones you see here.

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:27.645
This project is aimed at showing you what you'll be capable of making,

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:31.550
while at the same time getting some practice drawing insights from data.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.350
In the second project,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.715
you'll analyze data from the New York Stock Exchange SNP 500.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:41.630
You utilize your knowledge of statistics and spreadsheets

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.830
to draw insights from financial performance data of these companies.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.940
The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.935
create visual tools to communicate results in informative ways.

00:00:54.935 --> 00:01:00.695
You will also be applying your new skills to create financial forecasting models.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.585
In the third project,

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:06.200
you'll use data from a digital music store database to help

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.310
a company learn more about their employees and customers.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.220
Utilizing your SQL skills,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.240
you'll query a database to gain

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.815
real insights into data collected by an international company.

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:20.660
In the final project,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.720
you'll have the opportunity to look at airline data,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.570
and understand flight patterns throughout the world.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.320
You'll build amazing visualizations using Tableau,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.510
that will allow you to share information with

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.035
users that's not only beautiful, but informative.

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:39.080
We can't wait to see what you build.
