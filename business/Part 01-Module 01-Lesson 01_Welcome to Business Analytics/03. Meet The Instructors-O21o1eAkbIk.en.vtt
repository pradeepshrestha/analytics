00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Hi again, for the next couple of months,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.840
I'll be your guide through this program.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.995
I'm so excited to introduce the team that will be working with me to teach this course.

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:11.300
First, I want to introduce Dana.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.840
She's teaming up with me on the first material you'll learn.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.750
Hello, I'm Dana.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm an electrical engineer and computer scientist.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920
I have many years experience working in industry to solve

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.715
problems and answer technical questions based on data.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:31.800
Spreadsheets are one of my favorite tools for not only analyzing data but for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.375
creating charts and graphs to present my analysis clearly to clients and management.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.890
I'm going to step you through the basics of spreadsheets.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.495
Once you learn these basics,

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:46.230
you'll be well-equipped to take it to the next level yourself.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.661
In the next section,

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:49.392
you'll be learning from Derek.

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:51.650
Derek , do you want to tell them a little bit about yourself?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.700
I know we at Udacity are really excited

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.310
to have you a part of the team leading this course.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.150
Thanks Josh. My name's Derek and I'm the CEO of Mode Analytics.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.070
An analytics platform that makes it easy to quickly turn SQL queries into

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.540
reports and dashboards that you can share across your company.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.650
I use Mode throughout this course,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.740
so you get a glimpse at some of its functionality.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.080
I've worked in analytics jobs throughout my career,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.350
first in consulting then at tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.340
Everywhere I worked, I ended up teaching

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.745
basic data analysis skills to up and coming analysts.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.430
And it really frustrated me that all the SQL content I could

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.365
find was geared towards software developers rather than analysts.

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:40.620
This course incorporates everything I've learned from teaching SQL at previous jobs at

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.940
Data Science boot-camps and its scale in other tutorials have produced. Hope you enjoy.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
Then, you'll be learning data visualization and Tableau from Mat.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.815
Thanks. Hi there, I'm Mat.

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.875
Back in the day, I was a physicist,

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.400
a neuroscientist and a data scientist.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
I've been working with data now for almost 15 years,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.965
starting my journey by simulating physical systems in Excel.

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:06.420
In this program, I'll be covering one of the most important skills you'll need.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.560
Sharing your results with others.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.690
We will be using Tableau.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.135
It's an industry standard application for creating

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:15.000
amazing interactive visualizations. See you in class.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.727
And I'm Josh.

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:20.520
I'll be here to help you from start to graduation.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.410
I've been teaching introductory statistics courses and advanced graduate level classes

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.090
aimed at computer programming and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.285
data science at the University of Colorado Denver for the last few years.

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:35.522
I also have held a number of industry positions ranging from marketing analyst,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:40.020
to data scientist, to machine learning engineer, to biostatistician.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.205
Each of these positions was aimed at helping companies make the most of their data.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.290
Whether it be tracking and reporting,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.570
the success rates of drugs aimed to help people with cancer,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.202
or just building chat bots to bug my co-workers,

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:55.410
I've always had a passion for data and teaching.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.000
I can't wait to be your guide on this adventure.
