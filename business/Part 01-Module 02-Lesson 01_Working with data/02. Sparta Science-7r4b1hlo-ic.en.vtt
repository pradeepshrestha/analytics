00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.515
There is a sincere desire to compete and be part of the team,

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.810
and injuries sidetrack a lot of those intentions.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.500
My name is Phil Wagner and I'm the CEO and founder of Sparta science.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.590
Our goal is to provide a solution for any individual that's looking to be

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.880
active and really reducing and preventing the injuries that tend to occur.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.464
When I started noticing strains behind injuries,

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.305
I guess I wasn't thinking about data first,

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:40.290
because I think like most good practitioners I was thinking about the individual first,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.720
and how to avoid the frustration and

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.935
the emotional pain of enduring a setback like an injury.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:52.735
One of the defining characteristics of that is the data that that individual produces.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:56.370
The force plate analysis looks at ground reaction force.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.365
So, when you're jumping and you put force down it causes you to go up.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.700
So, more force into the ground allows you to jump higher.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.430
And those patterns are what we call movement signature.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.500
And that movement signature has been linked to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.795
different injury risks and different performance capabilities.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:19.650
The value of good data and really longitudinal data is you can start to identify trends,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.190
you can start to become predictive of which exercises and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.470
training programs are going to be most of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.935
effective at reducing or rehabilitating that injury.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.185
So, we work with Stanford University,

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:34.830
University of Pacific, Brigham Young University among several others.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.540
And what those relationships provide is really statistical expertise to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.960
identify how to continue to refine our assessment processes to be more reliable.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.640
And so, what makes us different is we've been able to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.610
reduce insurance premiums for universities

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.590
to save professional teams' money by having less days lost due to injury.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.515
And so, really having those kinds of results and that kind of impact,

00:02:01.515 --> 00:02:03.690
that is what makes Sparta unique.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.825
At the end of the day the value we're providing is not coming from having a force plate,

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.430
it's really from the datasets.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.560
So, we want to invest in the framework for software engineers to build that,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.810
and from data scientists to continue to make meaning out of those datasets.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.625
For me it all began thinking about,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:28.080
how do we address and help each individual person?
