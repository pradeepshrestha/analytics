00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Creating personas in marketing,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.180
you just imagine what Becky would like and what she wears,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.375
and where she shops, and why she would want to be a customer of your company.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.480
The way that we do it is we actually take real lead files from the client.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.565
We do analysis using LinkedIn data.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.540
This is their age, this is their title.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.640
We create personas for the client that are based on real data.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.060
My name is Emily Peters.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.695
I'm a brand strategist and I'm founder of Uncommon Bold.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.230
Uncommon Bold is a brand strategy studio.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.170
We help companies when they feel like they're misunderstood.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.085
We do a bunch of analysis and then we help them to choose

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.020
the direction that they want to go and hopefully to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.344
create something that's really easily understood,

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:43.125
really compelling and is going to help them get a ton of VC money,

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.895
a ton of press, a ton of people to join their company.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:50.400
My clients are all doctors and scientists and engineers,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.425
and they all think in data.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:55.800
The way I do a very detailed data analysis with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
media coverage for my clients to give them a sense of the quality of the coverage,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.430
not just the quantity they're receiving.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.980
So we created an algorithm, really simple,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.420
that helps to show,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
create a score that they can measure month over month to see how they're doing.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.760
When I first developed that,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.870
it was pretty transformational to have this very simple formula that was very

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.185
easy to understand but that nobody had ever used before.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:23.920
I actually posted it on my website and a lot of other people use it now.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.740
So that's nice to know that I'm helping

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.590
other people to demonstrate the value of their work.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.485
Everything needs to be managed and measured.

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:34.260
With data, you can actually go back and look at the numbers,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.655
look at the traction,

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:39.510
you can really get in there with a client and have tough conversations with them

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.590
because of using real information versus just opinion.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.320
You can get pretty far in your career without data.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.720
But, if you have a good sense of how to put

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.660
together a compelling slide or a compelling graph,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.820
it elevates your ability to really convince

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.680
other people to take the course of action you want to have.
