00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
My name is Mitchell Yerxa,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.135
I'm a fourth generation farmer here in Colusa, California,

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.670
I currently farm with my family and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.490
we've been farming the same ground for over 100 years.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.095
Every year, there's a little bit more innovation.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:23.940
We call it precision farming but Big Data is just truly data analysis.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.290
It's how you can process and how you can take in every bit of information you can.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.640
Every single day, we're using almost every level from algebra all the way

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.310
to higher in statistics or calculus to figure out not only the mapping,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.105
chemical rates, but also the estimation of your product in your state versus

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:48.675
other products from other countries and how those might influence

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.980
how buyers choose your product over something else.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.735
$930 billion is lost each year in either wasted food or overproduced food.

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:06.245
It's really been interesting to see a market in which people need food,

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:08.370
how do you not produce too much,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.830
and how do you get it to the end consumer much quicker.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.000
And so, it's been a really fascinating use of data,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.040
whereas for a grocer or

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.525
a distributor or any kind of a middleman between the farmer and the consumer,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.795
any time lost, any minute lost is value lost.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:29.520
There's truly billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars on the line.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.550
We're able to look at every single sector of

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.930
every single field to say what did each portion every field do,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.790
how did it do, what could it use more,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.930
what could it use less of,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.225
how we can be more productive with every square inch

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:45.239
of the same ground that we've been farming for four generations.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.880
There's so much data out there,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:59.340
it's just a matter of how do you utilize it simply.
