00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.015
A bottom up approach takes a micro approach to forecasting.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:12.330
The approach starts by looking at historical data.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.805
The more data you have, the better.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:20.265
But often, even as little as six months to one year data is used in this approach.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:23.700
The model forecasts are based on these data to make

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.255
assumptions about how the key metrics will behave,

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:32.010
and then we forecast out the revenue based on these assumptions.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.180
Let's look at a sample income statement that uses

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.965
bottom up approach to forecast out revenues and net income.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.220
For instance, we started with the historical data.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.895
For example, last year's income statement metrics,

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.450
then we use this historical numbers to calculate out

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.255
margin metrics as well as historical income tax rates and interest expenses.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.240
The next step is to use those margins and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.030
metrics to come up with the assumptions for the future,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.420
in this case, the following year.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.810
Finally, using those assumptions in our model,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.555
we forecast out the key metrics for next year.

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:17.060
As you can see, bottom up approach is based on assumptions as well,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.955
but it is built on previously attained numbers.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:23.150
There are specific to how the company has performed,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.040
and not generalizations that relate to the market as a whole.
