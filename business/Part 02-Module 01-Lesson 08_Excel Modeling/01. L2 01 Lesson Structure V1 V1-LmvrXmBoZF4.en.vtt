Welcome to this lesson on Excel modeling.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.330
This lesson will build nicely on the business metric lesson.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.640
Now that you know how to calculate and interpret a business metric,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.565
you can start forecasting the key metrics.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.470
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.675
you will understand the fundamentals of sales and financial forecasting models.

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:31.415
This lesson will prepare you nicely for the project at the end of the lesson.

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:35.780
The project will have you use actual S&amp;P 500 data from

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.185
the New York Stock Exchange to forecast out a P&amp;L statement for a company of your choice.

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:47.030
The data will include financial performance data from over 500 companies.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.470
By the end of the course,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.910
you will have mastered how to use advanced Excel tools,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.430
and this will set you up nicely for completing the project.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.440
So, let's get started.
