00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.360
Let's go over a top-down model that focuses on bookings for sales person.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.265
The model is divided into four portions here.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:13.270
We're starting with an assumptions about the dollar amount we need in bookings.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.910
Then we figured out how much time and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.240
effort it would require to get to generate those bookings.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.415
Let's look at this more closely.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.620
We start with an assumption about

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.240
how productive this sales person who we are going to hire will be.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.650
We measure this in terms of the number of opportunities being generated,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.100
and then we look at how much revenue on average

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.085
would this person generate per unit and per an opportunity.

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:45.160
We use these assumptions to arrive at

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.365
the average size of opportunity we can expect the sales person to generate.

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.695
Then we make assumptions about how much time and

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:57.220
effort it will take us to arrive at those bookings.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.940
For this, we project out when we will hire the person.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.180
Then based on our sales historical data,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.290
we come up with the assumption that a new sales member would take

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.930
X number of months to get up to speed to start generating those leads and bookings.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.230
Then finally, we use the ramp time and the average size of opportunity assumptions,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.390
to project out when he will see the bookings that we expect this person to generate.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.260
As you can see, we get to the final bookings number for each sales team member and month,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.050
by starting with our bookings in the more broad sense and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.400
then narrowing down to each person and month.
