00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.945
To build out the financial model,

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.115
let's first take a look at some Excel functions and tools for financial modeling.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:14.860
As we introduce you to each of these,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.690
we will work towards the financial model.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.725
So, this will set you up nicely for your final project.

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:23.830
Data validation is an Excel tool that

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.490
allows you to limit what values are accepted in a cell.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.385
You can create drop-down list of items,

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:34.540
restrict cell value to data ranges and numbers.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.150
Index function is used when you want the cell to have a value chosen from

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.275
a specified array and row number indicated within the index function.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:50.300
Match is the lookup function that can locate the position of the lookup value

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.260
within an array only when it needs specific criteria to find in the match function.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.640
Index and Match together and a powerful feature for advanced formulas.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640
Together they can give a value from an array,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.400
the purpose of the index function based on

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.225
a numeric position which is provided by the match function.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.085
Finally, offset.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:17.200
Here you can select a start point in the spreadsheet and tell

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.495
Excel to return a set of styles that are counted from the starting point.

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:26.440
We are going to work through an actual example for each of these in the coming videos.
