00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Let's look at this spreadsheet.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.360
We have some ticker symbols in this column here and then a bunch of financial data,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.405
then we'll get to in a short while.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:10.890
Looking at this ticker symbol,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.820
we can see that each ticker symbol is repeated a few times.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
We want to create as part the data validation is a drop-down list that

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.610
contains only one occurrence of each of these ticker symbols.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.900
To get started, we're going to use pivot tables.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.695
Well, there are many ways to create data validation drop-down list.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.225
This is one of the ways.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.114
So, we select ticker symbols,

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:39.015
you go insert, fill the table,

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.430
we've selected the cell already,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.515
and we say new worksheet,

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:45.980
and it creates a pivot table here for us.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.035
We select ticker symbol,

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.600
and it shows up under the rows,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.060
and you can see any repeated occurrences of each ticker symbol had been eliminated,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.610
and each symbol shows up only once.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.600
We need access to this unique list of names.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.075
I'm going to go ahead and paste it in here,

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:09.035
and then once I've pasted and I'm going to go ahead and select it again,

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:14.390
and use name box to give this list a name called company list.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.415
So, I'm going to have the selector,

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.910
go to name box here and go to company list.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.330
Once I've done that, I can reference this list by

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.970
simply calling this name in my formulas.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.380
We can now go ahead and create a new worksheet here.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.900
We're going to call it data validation.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.710
I'm going to type in ticker symbol because I want this to show up next to that,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.510
and then in this cell,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.710
I'm going to go Data, Data Validation.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.355
You have the option to choose various criteria.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:48.890
So, I'm going ahead and select a list,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.585
and as a source,

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:53.915
I'm going to reference back to this list here,

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.725
and I can see it automatically filled into named box,

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:01.490
and I go ahead and click Okay, and there you have it.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.855
You have a data drop-down menu that only references each of these names separately.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:11.210
Another trick I just want to mention is that if you find

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.800
that you're having problems with the data range it's not showing up correctly,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.245
you can go to the formula tab at the top,

00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:20.200
and you can go to Name Manager,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.385
and here you can actually see all named boxes that you have,

00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:28.530
and it tells you which file it's referring to,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.610
and you can confirm which ones you want to delete,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.185
which ones you want to edit,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:37.975
or you can use the edit option to do that and correct the reference,

00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:40.375
which sheet did refers to.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.980
So, this is also an option if you're having some trouble with

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.530
the Data Validation. See you in the next video.
