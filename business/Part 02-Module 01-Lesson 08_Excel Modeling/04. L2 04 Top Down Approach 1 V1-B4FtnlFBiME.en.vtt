00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
Forecasting model requires careful thinking

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.605
about which approach you want to take to create the models.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.455
One approach to modeling is top-down.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.750
It takes a macro approach to forecasting.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.290
Here, you start with the best estimate of the larger size of

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.960
the market narrowing down to identify

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
the portion of the market that the company is serving,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.925
and then estimate what it will take to capture that portion of the market.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.520
Top-down is a macro approach,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.570
but it is less credible and typically adopted when there's limited historical data.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.680
We'll next look at an example that shows why this is less credible.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.215
Let's go to the weaker example.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.290
We start with the online grocery delivery market,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.275
which is about $20 billion,

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:52.975
and then we start getting into the specifics,

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:56.960
such as which market segments the company wants to focus on.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.345
Say the executive team at WeCart wants to retain the focus on the urban market,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:04.810
which is about $17 million.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.725
Now, the assumption is that WeCart will aim to capture five percent of this market,

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:14.805
and with that we arrive at $850,000.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:17.580
Finally, based on our product pricing,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.080
say $4.95 per delivery,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.915
we can now arrive at our sale quantity estimates of about a 170,000 customer orders.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:30.020
As you can see, this is a less credible way to forecast because

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.085
you're talking in guesses and estimates based on macro figures.

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.860
It's harder to convince potential investors you

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.600
can realistically achieve this forecasted revenue.
