00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.440
In modeling, assumptions on what you think will come

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.395
to for the inputs or metrics in the model.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:15.720
It can be assumptions about the circumstances that affect the metrics in the model.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.565
To build your assumptions out,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.915
you start with information available to you based on historical data.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.680
For example, we can assume we will continue to gain

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.895
market share at the same rate as we have for the last six months,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.690
or we assume that we will continue to see spikes and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.635
sales around holidays or on certain days of the week.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.570
As you make assumptions,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.115
pay attention to your forecasts about metrics you have less control over.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:47.570
Costs are usually harder to change drastically.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.070
So, when you make your assumptions about reducing the future costs,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.975
make sure you're being realistic.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.605
For instance, when estimating the cost of delivery,

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:03.590
the cost of gas is typically harder to predict since gas prices are fairly volatile.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.950
So, in general, be careful about the assumptions you make about changes in costs,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.920
and check to see if those assumptions are reasonable and make sense.
