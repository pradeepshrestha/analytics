00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Offsets are useful tools for scenario analysis.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.780
We can see how in this example when we change the scenario,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.760
it changes the assumptions here,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.950
and when the assumptions are changed,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.845
it changes the forecasted Sinek metrics here.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:16.005
Let's build one scenario analysis.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.450
I split up the video into various steps.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.865
So, they're building on each concept.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:26.010
For starters, lets define the four steps to take to create a financial forecast.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460
Step 1 is to calculate

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.685
the operating statistics that include the gross and operating margin, and revenue growth.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:36.980
This is all based on the historical data,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.860
which you can find in the income statement over here.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.155
So, this is step 1.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:42.590
The first box here.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.665
Step 2 is to create the scenarios.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.980
I have them here in this box here.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.560
So, this is the scenario that we are going to be creating.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.135
Typically, we have a strong base and weak case.

00:00:55.135 --> 00:00:59.020
Some business analysts choose to have two additional scenarios as well,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.980
we're going to stick with three cases.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.950
Then come the assumptions as part of step 3.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.170
These assumptions change in response to the scenario that is chosen over here.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.210
This is where we're going to use offset.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.340
Finally, step 4 may be develop the forecasted scenarios that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.740
change dynamically based on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.360
the scenarios that are chosen because that affects the assumptions,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.545
and the assumptions go inside the forecasted metrics.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:28.940
So, for step 1,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.320
we need to calculate

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.280
our gross and operating margin here for a based on a historical data.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.015
So, we have this original data that we have seen before,

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:45.390
and the gross margin is basically one minus the cost of revenue or cost of goods sold,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.370
those two terms are interchangeable over the total revenue.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.800
So, you plug in this formula in here,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.975
copy and paste it, and it gives us the gross margin.

00:01:54.975 --> 00:02:01.190
For operating margin, this is your operating profit over your total revenue.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.880
So, now we have our historical margin ratios here.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.250
I've plugged them in here using our index and match functions.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.025
So, I've referred to this as the named box for gross margin you can see,

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:20.180
and this is named box for operating margin.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.160
So, I just said okay within the gross margin array,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.530
give me an exact match for where the ticker symbol and your- as you can see,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.550
ticker symbol and your are matched and give me

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.105
that particular gross margin or operating margin,

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:43.050
and plug it in for me into these cells.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.670
So, that's what I did here,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.035
and then four operating margin,

00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:50.465
I reference the array is referring to the operating margin

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:56.585
saying give me that exact ticker symbol and your match and plug in that value.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.760
Revenue growth, you're just taking

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.975
your current year's revenue over your previous year's revenue minus one.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:09.005
What essentially does is it gives you the difference

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.410
between the two years of revenue based on

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.110
last year's revenue so you can see how much

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.075
the revenue growth has occurred in the current year based on last year's revenue.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.470
I'm using HPE as a ticker symbol,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130
so you can see all the 3-years historical data.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.990
You can see this looks different for the companies with just two years data,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.165
but I delete the financial forecast would actually be for one company,

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:35.360
for your own company so,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.820
you're going to have this as a dynamic array.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.400
Okay. So, we have the historical upgrading statistics here and step 1 is done.
