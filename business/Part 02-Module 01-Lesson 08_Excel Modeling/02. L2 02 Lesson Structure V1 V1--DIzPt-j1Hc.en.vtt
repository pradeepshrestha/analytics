00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.060
So, you might be asking yourself,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.980
what will this lesson cover?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.950
First, we will start with a brief introduction to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.625
fundamental ideas used in creating forecasting models.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.815
We will review the two approaches to modeling, top-down and bottom-up,

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.600
you will learn about inputs and outputs of a model,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.110
and the types of inputs required to create models.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.560
We will practice Excel functions and tools that can

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.205
make forecasting models easier and interactive.

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:37.610
You will learn advanced tools like Index, Match,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.765
and Offset that can come in handy during scenario analysis.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:46.265
I'm so excited to show you the ins and outs of modeling techniques in Excel.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:47.760
So, let's dig in.
