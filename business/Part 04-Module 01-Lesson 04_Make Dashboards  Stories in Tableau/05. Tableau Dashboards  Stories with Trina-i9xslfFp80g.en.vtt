00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.800
Hi, welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.512
So now I sm interested in how you
as a Tableau professional actually

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:09.140
start exploring a dataset.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.110
And the fun thing about Tableau
is that there are 1 million and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.090
1 ways to explore data.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.660
You can start with
a question that you have and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.560
then try to answer that
question in the data.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.817
Or you can start just by
looking at the dimensions and

00:00:23.817 --> 00:00:27.813
measures that you have and
dragging those out onto the canvas and

00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:32.789
changing things around and changing
the aggregation and starting to explore.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.180
And everyone has a different process.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.980
You can invent your own process.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.990
I often invent new processes.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.630
But one of the first things that I
usually do is I take a look at the data

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.370
that I'm working with, because often it
wasn't data that I personally collected.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.630
In this case, I've brought a dataset
that the UN collected on refugee data.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.750
So, we're looking at asylum seekers,
where they came from,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.620
where they ended up,
when they ended up in those countries.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.190
And I've already taken
a step to clean up the data,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.370
often that's a necessary step
before you start visualizing it.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.920
And in this case it was really easy,
I just checked this check

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.440
box to clean it with our data
interpreter and that took away a few

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.260
rows in the beginning that weren't
related to the rest of the dataset.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.110
So then I'm going to open up a sheet and
I'm going to start asking questions.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.050
So one of the things that
I want to know is how many

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.660
people are in this dataset, right?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.550
How many people are we
talking about here?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.930
So I'm going to drag this
over onto the canvas and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.100
I can see that we're talking about
a bit over 8 million asylum seekers.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.710
Okay, so that's interesting.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.750
Now I want to know where did
these people come from and so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.870
I'm going to drag their
origin onto the columns.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.770
Now this is a little bit difficult for
me to see.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.040
It would be helpful
if I could rotate it.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.530
So I'm going to swap the axes here and
then I'm going to sort the data.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.800
And now I can start to see a story.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.540
And I can start to see where
these asylum seekers originated.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.830
So, now at this point how would
you say you use filters to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.520
keep digging in to the data?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.380
So Tableau makes it really easy to
narrow down your data and drill in and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.400
understand the data from
different perspectives.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.250
So in this case, for example,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.690
I have a date that might
be interesting to explore.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.040
So, I'm going to show a filter for
the date and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.890
then instead of check boxes,
I want to have a single value list.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.700
And now I can start to see trends and
ask questions.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.180
For example the data in 1999 looks
different than the data in 2008.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.020
And so now you can start to say, what
was it that caused those changes and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.485
what can I learn from this dataset?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.400
&gt;&gt; Right, so now that we're diving
deeper with the filters and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.310
all that, how would you actually
start making this into a dashboard so

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.570
that you can share these
interesting stories with others?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so dashboard is a series of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.330
parts that when combined
are greater then the whole, right?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.258
So a number of visualizations that could
be combined to tell a different story or

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:17.666
show you a different
perspective of your data.

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:22.945
So here I I have a bar chart,
but this is geographic data,

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:25.915
so it might also be interesting
to look at it as a map.

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:28.656
So here I have a dimension
that shows the country and

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:32.800
I'm going to click on a little Show Me
section in the corner here that's going

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.214
to suggest some visualizations and
here it's selected a map.

00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:44.320
So if I add this map, it is now showing
me where asylum seekers ended up.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.890
All of the countries that took in asylum
seekers are represented by a single dot.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.170
But I also want to know how many
asylum seekers went to each country.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.040
So I might take this number of asylum
seekers and drag this onto color.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.099
And now, we can start to see where
there were some hotspots, so

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.408
it looks like Germany is a hotspot.

00:04:07.408 --> 00:04:12.106
And actually all of Europe looks
kind of interesting, so I'm going to

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:16.970
zoom in on Europe, and now I can start
to see a geographic story emerge.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.490
Now, there's also a time
dimension in this

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.950
dataset that's interesting to explore.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.640
And so one of the things that I could
do is I could look at the number

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.500
of asylum seekers and
then I could look at the date, okay?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.710
And see Tableau automatically
changed that into a line chart for

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.320
me, because a line is a really
good way to explore dates.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.240
And now this date actually also
comes with a built-in hierarchy.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.498
And what that means is I can
see a plus button here and

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:58.150
that means that I can drill down further
to Quarter or to, for example, Month.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.720
And I can start to see
the data in different ways and

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.710
from different perspectives.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.230
Now, if I wanted to turn
this into a dashboard,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.790
I would tap on the new
dashboard icon here.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.200
And here I have sheets
that are in the corner for

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.830
me, and I can start dragging those
onto my dashboard and if I hover

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.100
over them I see a little thumbnail that
helps me know what I'm looking at.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.080
So I'm going to drag that sheet here.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.390
I'm going to drag the map out on top.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.320
And them I'm going to drag
this line chart to the side.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.820
Now, I can't quite see
everything that's going on, so

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.260
I'm going to change this from
fixed size to automatic.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.530
And then, they're a couple of
things that I want to do here.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.717
I want to take away these titles,
they're not really helping me right now.

00:05:48.717 --> 00:05:51.477
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:56.100
So we'll remove those, and
then we'll remove this.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.030
And then I want to, one of the other
cool things that you can do with

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.400
Tableau is that you can use
visualizations as filters.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.780
So that's another really interesting
thing that you can do with filters.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.840
So here, we have filters for dates,
but we can also filter by country.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.310
So what I can do is I can click on
this button to use as a filter.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.940
And then I can take this filter for

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.740
date and I can apply it to all of the
worksheets using this data source, okay?

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.940
And then I'm going to do
a simple customization here,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.690
I'm also going to float this.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.892
I'm going to change it to a drop
down and then I will resize it.

00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:50.982
And put it on the map here and
I'll take this away, okay.

00:06:50.982 --> 00:06:55.080
And now we have a visualization.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.050
And if I put that into full screen mode,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.870
you have this beautiful view where
you can start to explore data, right?

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.030
So now I can see what's happening
in France in 2008 versus 2014,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.580
for example, right?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.910
And you can start really digging in and
asking questions and

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.370
exploring in a very rich way.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.900
&gt;&gt; Great, that was really cool,
I like that.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.520
Okay, so these are dashboards, but

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.220
Tableau also let's you build stories,
right?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.492
So, what' s the difference between
a story and a dashboard and

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.612
when would you use one rather the other?

00:07:32.612 --> 00:07:34.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question and

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.590
I like to think of it as a story has
a narrative and it has a sequence.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.480
You want people to understand
the information in a particular order.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.240
So with a dashboard it gives you
an overview of what's going on.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.002
So I think of it kind of like you
just show up at the food track and

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.800
there's the menu on the side and

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.780
you want a picture of what all
the different options are.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.165
And maybe you're only interested
in appetizers right now.

00:07:57.165 --> 00:07:59.973
It's really easy for
you to find that appetizer section and

00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:01.272
just get something small.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:05.110
A story on the other hand
is more like a Comic book.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.840
You really want to understand
the history and context and

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.520
understand how you came to
a particular conclusion.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.523
So, you can also build
stories in Tableau, so

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:18.382
I'm going to click on
the new story button.

00:08:18.382 --> 00:08:22.920
And maybe I want to tell the story of
how I arrived at a particular insight.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.480
So here I can take the sheets and
dashboards and

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.110
combine them into stories.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:34.030
So maybe I start with this sheet and
I add it here and I add a caption.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:42.947
This is the first part of my story and
then I can take another sheet and

00:08:42.947 --> 00:08:47.800
I can add a new story point and
add a caption.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.162
Here's where I found this insight.

00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:59.897
And you can also add dashboards as well,
right?

00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:04.885
And in this case we're also going to
move this, change this to automatic so

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:07.506
I can see everything that's going on.

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:13.148
And when we go to our story we can start
by sharing the first part of the story

00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:19.340
and then move people along in sequence,
so that they understand your insights.
