00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.160
Customer Acquisition Cost or CAC is used as a metric in the very last step in our funnel,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.495
where the customer has actually bought a product or service on the website.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:22.120
We use the CAC metric to figure out how much it costs to acquire a paid customer.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.615
Remember, our ultimate goal is to increase these conversions at the bottom of the funnel.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:33.810
Considering e-commerce shopping cart abandonment rates are well over 60 percent,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.630
each company's goal is to make sure you're getting

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
higher levels of conversions for the minimum cost of sales in marketing.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.110
This idea is linked to the concept of optimizing the funnel.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.680
We will cover this later in the lesson.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.155
CAC is computed by dividing all the costs

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.860
spent on acquiring more customers, marketing expenses,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.795
sales and marketing salaries,

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:02.870
by the number of customers converted to paid customers in the period the money was spent.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.270
A good rule of thumb is that you want your CAC to be 25 percent of the revenue,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.675
the money you earn from all your customers.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:15.480
Next, you'll perform a sample computation of CAC.
