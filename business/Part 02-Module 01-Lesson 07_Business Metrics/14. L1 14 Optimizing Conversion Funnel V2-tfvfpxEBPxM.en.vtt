00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.405
In order to acquire new customers,

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.150
customers must step through each step of the funnel.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
Now, let's take a few minutes to talk about optimizing the funnel.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.565
Optimizing the funnell requires identifying at

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.160
what level of the funnel your customer loss is the greatest.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.745
So, the business team can target those leakage points.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.770
In other words, are you losing the most customers at the awareness and interest age,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.530
or is it when you are converting them into leads?

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.755
If you're losing many of them in the early stages of awareness,

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.980
you need to focus on the types of ads you're creating,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.090
or the ad platforms you're choosing to reach your potential customers.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.190
On the other hand, if you're losing many of them at the conversion stage,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.130
you need to look at your website, or online app.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.190
It's possible the site is not easy to navigate,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.870
and that's why not many customers are converting to paid customers.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.515
So, essentially, you're calculating the conversions,

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.130
or your success rate at getting a potential customer to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.120
do what you want them to do at each level of the marketing funnel,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.050
and you compare this number against your impressions.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.840
Let's look an example in the next video.
