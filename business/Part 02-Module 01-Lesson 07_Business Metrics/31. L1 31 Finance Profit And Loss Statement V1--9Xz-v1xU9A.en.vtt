A profit and loss statement or PNL statement is also called an income statement.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.350
It is one type of financial statement that shows

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
a company's performance position over a period of time.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.235
It is typically prepared at the end of each quarter or on an annual basis.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.320
As part of the PNL statement,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.900
you list your revenue and expenses,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.435
and it tells you the profit or loss

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:34.680
your organization is experiencing over a specific period of time.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.465
Below, I provided the terminology you will see included in the PNL statement.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:42.840
