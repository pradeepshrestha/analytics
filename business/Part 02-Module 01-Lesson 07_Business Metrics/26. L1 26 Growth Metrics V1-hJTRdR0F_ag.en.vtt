00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.690
Now, we will shift gears to talk about

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.095
metrics useful for measuring your company's growth.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:15.105
Here growth for a website or app is counted in the number of users.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:20.430
Are we seeing the number of people actually using the site increasing or decreasing?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.175
If you see your website use as high,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.790
are they unique users or the same people coming back?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.720
An important aspect of growth is not just whether you have

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.005
users but whether they continue to actively use or engage with the website.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.510
We'll talk about the following metrics: active users,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.135
which can range from monthly, weekly,

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:47.825
to daily; stickiness, which is derived from the monthly and daily active users;

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:49.940
and finally, churn rate.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.440
Ready? Let's jump into it.
