00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
Each industry may be healthcare, insurance, construction,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.370
entertainment, they use their own unique set of KPIs.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.605
In this course, we will not be going over industry-specific KPIs,

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:20.145
instead we'll be focusing on most commonly used KPIs by business analysts.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.340
This will by no means be representative of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
all the KPIs you might use in your industries, but that's okay.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.310
If you are in a specific industry,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.300
you can spend some time to learn about KPIs in a specific domain.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
For the next quiz,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.790
I'd like you to visit this page and identify the KPIs used for specific industries.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.250
To arrive at this,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.045
follow the link in the text item below,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.545
I'll go there write down.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:51.885
Go kpidashboards.com, you can go to the LEARN link,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.545
scroll down where it says KPI examples

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.720
and you can see any of the examples within each industry.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.520
They are sorted By Department on

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.800
the left side and then By Industry. Good luck with the quiz.
