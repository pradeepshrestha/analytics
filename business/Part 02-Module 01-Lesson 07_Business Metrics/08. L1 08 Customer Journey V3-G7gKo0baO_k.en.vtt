00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.840
Let's walk through the journey of WeCart,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.230
our hypothetical online app for grocery delivery.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.800
To track the customer's journey in the online space,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.515
you begin with identifying specific ad platforms such as search engines,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.625
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and many others.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:28.590
This way, the app company can see how many users actually saw the ad.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.630
Next, in the marketing journey,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
a viewer who has seen the ad in any of these places will click on the ad.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000
Great. Now, the viewer is on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.435
the WeCart website and a cookie gets placed on the viewers browser.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:45.455
You've probably encountered cookies when web surfing.

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:48.770
You remember those warnings you get that cookies being placed,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.705
if you continue using the website?

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.510
Yes, we're talking about that feature.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.340
Once that cookie is placed,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.870
the company is tracking what the potential customer is doing on the website.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.485
For example, whether the person is browsing or selecting items for purchase.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:09.215
Essentially, it tracks a potential customers progress

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:14.345
along the customer journey whenever the customer interacts with the website.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.730
So, now the company's goal is to get

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.515
this potential customer to do something on the website.

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:21.990
In the case of WeCart,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100
it could be something as simple as getting the customer

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.290
to give their email address or download a brochure.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.490
When a customer's action is a result of a prompt it is called Call to Action.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.070
So, when the customer is prompted to submit the email,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.335
that is referred to as Call to Action or CTA. Next step.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:45.290
If the customer adds items to their cart,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.275
the cookie tracks this step in the customer journey to becoming a paid customer.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:53.195
So, now WeCart would want these customers who have

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.345
added items to the cart to make that purchase,

00:01:56.345 --> 00:02:01.360
and finally, the viewer submits the payment details and goes through checkout.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.320
Now, you have a paid customer and they've completed the customer journey.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.385
This customer journey can be described by five stages;

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:16.755
Awareness, Interest, Desire, Purchase, and Post-purchase.

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:21.110
In each stage, the marketer uses different digital tools to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.705
attract a potential customer and try to transform them into an actual customer.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.180
This customer journey can also be tracked along

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.160
a marketing funnel which is a concept we will talk about in the next video.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
The funnel allows you to tie everything together on

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.120
the customer journey and track with a good content along the journey.
