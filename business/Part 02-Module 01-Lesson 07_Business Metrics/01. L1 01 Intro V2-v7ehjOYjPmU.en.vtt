00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi there. I'm Richie.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.810
Welcome to this lesson on working with business metrics,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.170
an essential topic for any business analyst.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.365
We will focus on metrics that are commonly used

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.205
across industries and a wide range of business roles,

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:24.270
such as marketing, growth, sales, and finance.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.130
As a business analyst,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.665
it is important to analyze and convey

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:34.020
your company's performance using specific metrics in each of these areas.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.970
You will not only learn about how to calculate these metrics,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.805
but also how to interpret them.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.415
A picture can say a lot,

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:47.540
which is why you will also learn how to create visualizations that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.100
will help everyone gain new insights into your company's performance.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.760
All of these new skills will help you enhance your data analysis work.
