00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
As you can see in this worksheet,

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.140
we've captured the steps in the funnel,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.480
with some additional customer touch points where you want the customer to do

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.220
something once they arrive on your website, download a brochure,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.020
share the email, add items to the cart,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.720
[inaudible] one where their denominator,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.450
is the number of original count of people who arrive at your website; the impressions.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.400
Second, where the denominator is the number of people who

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.600
completed the Call to Action at the previous level in the panel.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.940
Let's first calculate the conversion rates based

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.195
on the number of visitors to the website.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:38.505
So, we have a column;

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.590
conversion rates based on impression.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860
Here, it shows you the formula that I'm using,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.635
and you're going with B4 divided by B3.

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:50.450
We're going to just leave this as,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.550
well, so you can see.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:02.670
Here is B5 divided by B3 and B6 divided by B3.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
So, you can see that 43 percent roughly of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.265
the people who saw the actual add, downward the brochure.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:17.070
Of them, 19 percent arrived on the site,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.870
added items to the cart.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.590
So, eight percent the people who arrived in the website actually purchased the item.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.900
Now, let's calculate the conversion rates,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.840
based on the number of people who completed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.625
the Call to Action at the previous level in funnel.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.070
I have the formula here,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.975
so that you can track what I'm doing.

00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:41.220
Here, this will be B4 divided by B3,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.140
because that's the original step.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.790
So, people arrive in the website,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.380
and then they download of the brochure,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.945
43 percent of that matches what's in the conversion rate based on the impression.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.530
Next, we're going to go B5 is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.465
divided by the number of people who downloaded the brochure,

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:03.810
and the number of people who purchased the item,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.190
based on the number of people who added the items.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.910
So, let's reduce the number of decimals here.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.670
So, we can see this indicates that 45 percent of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.010
the people who download the brochure added their items to the cart.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.330
Of those, 39 percent actually purchased the item.
