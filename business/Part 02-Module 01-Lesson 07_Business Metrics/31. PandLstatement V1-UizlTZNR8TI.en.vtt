00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
So let's go ahead and create a profit and loss statement for Ricard.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.845
Since we Ricard is a service company,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:13.500
I've included expenses that are typical service company and sales company would incur.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.660
If this was a manufacturing company,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.780
some of the expenses that are missing in here would be

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.130
the cost of the raw materials that you need to make your product.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.830
Let's get started. So, cost of goods sold would be the sum of these expenses.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
The engineering costs for hosting the websites,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.015
for the charges for the payment system,

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:37.740
packaging, and delivery costs.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.145
So, I'll going ahead and added those up and that gives me the cost of goods sold.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.275
It's important to remember that your P and L statement and what goes into

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:49.220
each line item changes by the type of business you are working with.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.005
Again, if you're curious about it,

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.795
feel free to check out the links below. All right.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:01:01.220
Moving on, our gross profit is our revenue minus cost of goods sold,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.200
and our selling general and administrative expenses are the salaries,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.470
legals fees, rent for office and utilities.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.065
This will be sum of these numbers.

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:15.175
To get the total operating expenses,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:19.250
I'm going to add in the recent development expenses as well.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.740
So, this will be sum of this and this SGAs.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.720
So, to arrive at EBIT or earnings before interest and tax or operating profit or income,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.160
these are all synonymous for the same word,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.670
you have to subtract the total operating expenses from the gross profit.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.749
Then, finally, to arrive at our net income or net profit,

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.140
you need to subtract from your EBIT or

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.710
operating profit the sum of your interest expenses and the income tax,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.005
and so we arrive at our net income.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.350
So, that's a profit and loss statement.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.540
You started with the total revenue,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.035
took out the expenses of building the products,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.440
which in the case of the Ricard here,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140
it's a SaaS company,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
I'm included the services cost as well.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.800
For a manufacturing company,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.260
this would include the cost of raw materials,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.745
got the gross profit.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:31.150
Then I took out the overhead expenses as a selling general and administrative expenses,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.490
and then added the R and D expenses to get the total operating expenses,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.650
then took out and used gross profit to take out

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.455
the total operating expenses and got my EBIT or operating profit.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:50.400
Then, finally, the interest expenses and income tax are taken out to get your net income.
