00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Let's look at this table for sale leads provided across the 10 regions.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:06.930
We've also provided the average here.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.330
The chart depicts the same information with

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.585
the average sale leads depicted in the dash line.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.670
Now if you simply looked at the average sale leads across the 10 sales regions,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.575
you would assume that your sales team got about 430 leads on average.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.245
However, that is not the full story.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.850
That is the reason why you examine the median and you find out that

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.725
actually 50 percent of your regions sell below the average.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.000
The median here is depicted in this purple line here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.755
If you are presenting to your company executives,

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:43.995
that is not a convincing story as they would wonder,

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:47.765
"Well, what is a difference between a 100 leads?

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.200
That looks like a big difference between the average and the median."

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.620
That's why it's always important to look at the distribution.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.465
You see when we crafted and compare the mean and the median,

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:02.130
you see that the region 10 did exceptionally well.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.885
This type of negatively skewed data necessitates the use of measures of central tendency.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.720
Looking at your measure of central tendency mean,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.360
median are very important as you are missing

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.260
vital inflammation if you skip this part in your analysis.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.375
In other words, what you're seeing in region 10 was what was pulling the mean up.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.705
This revelation can lead to further investigation.

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:31.470
For example, why did region 10 have so many more leads than the other regions?

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.895
What was unique about it?

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:36.410
Is there an untapped market we don't know about or

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.465
maybe the sales manager in charge of that region did well? You get the drift.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:45.830
Looking at the larger context and the distribution always gives you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.155
more information than you can simply by looking at one number such as the average.

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:56.750
These are important pieces of information that you need to bring

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.670
back to your company and decision makers as a business analyst.
