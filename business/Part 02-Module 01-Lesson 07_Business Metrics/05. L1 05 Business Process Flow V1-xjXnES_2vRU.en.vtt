00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.645
A business has two primary goals: to increase revenue and reduce costs.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:14.370
Metrics allow the company to know if they're on track to meet those goals.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.070
Let's use our WeCart example.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.590
First, the business executives need to think

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.755
about the cost they will encounter in building,

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.500
promoting, and carrying out their business.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.325
Let's look at some broad categories of costs for WeCart.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:36.345
For starters, their costs for setting up the website and engineering, salaries of staff,

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:38.730
basic supplies for deliveries,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.990
costs for the payment system,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.215
legal contracts with the manufacturers and their delivery staff,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.345
and rent for the office.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:50.555
Next, let's focus on increasing revenue.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:52.670
To do this, we will need to get

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.810
new customers as there are a lot of people who don't know about the product.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.985
We need to get their attention.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:02.255
Getting you customers is a multi-step process.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:07.025
We need to get ads ready and track their effectiveness to generate interest

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.440
among viewers on several platforms so they ultimately buy the product.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.570
Each step of the journey is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.400
an opportunity to see how well we're doing with respect to our goal.
