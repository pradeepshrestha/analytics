00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
To calculate churn rate,

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:07.200
we need two pieces of data for the time period we're calculating the churn rate for.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.745
First, how many costumers were with us at the beginning of the time period?

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.340
Then, of those costumers,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.240
how many remained with us by the end of the time period?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.040
So, for week A here,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.710
we have churn rate being calculated for each month.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.115
This is the formula we're going to be using.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:30.650
Essentially, this is calculating the difference between

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.400
these numbers and dividing it by the beginning number.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.875
So, let's go ahead and calculate this.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:44.520
So, this will be 135 minus 130 over 135.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.060
So, as you can see,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.440
they have some churn over the year with the highest being in the month of February.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.500
When we started with 155 customers,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.935
but we're left with only 140 of those.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:03.590
But we more than made up by having a few months of very good growth rate.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.725
Remember, growth rate is tracking the number of new users per month,

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.785
which is reflected in the increasing number of

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:17.120
new customers at the beginning of the month in the second part of the year.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.235
While the churn rate keeps a tally of last customers,

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:26.555
the growth rate follows how many new paid customers started buying from the company.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:29.450
To experience growth, a company should aim to have

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.870
a growth rate that is higher than the churn rate.
