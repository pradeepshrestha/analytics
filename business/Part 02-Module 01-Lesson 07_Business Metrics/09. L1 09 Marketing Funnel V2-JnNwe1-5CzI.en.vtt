00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.185
Let's go through the concept of the marketing funnel.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.325
Now that we understand the journey a potential customer goes through,

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.385
we can use the metaphor of a funnel to track

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:17.895
and analyze each step in the journey with data.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:22.440
Impressions and reach capture the person seeing the ad.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.410
Lead generation is visiting the website,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.565
and buying something is conversion to a paid customer.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:31.845
So, at the top, we're trying to build

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:35.625
awareness and get our name in front of the potential customer.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:42.315
To do this, we use ad platforms and search engine optimization or SEO.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:45.770
With SEO, we can make sure our ad shows up for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.165
the right mix of search terms as people are searching for things online.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:54.860
For example, search terms like grocery delivery or grocery shopping

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.765
would be a good search term when we cart it ad shows up for the person.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:04.760
The metrics we can measure here are the number of people who saw the ad.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.320
Some of those people will click the ad and be taken to our website.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.450
To be counted at this level,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.220
the user should have clicked through the ad or the email sent to them.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.000
The metrics we use here are called click-through rate and cost per click.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.205
At this third level,

00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:28.010
the user has been counted because they have visited the company website.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.130
But just because someone landed on your web page,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.500
that does not mean the person is interested in

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.950
spending money on buying a product from your website.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.475
More sites try to capture some other piece of information

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:44.225
about you to determine if you're indeed interested.

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.420
The most common is your email.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.580
With your email, they will then have the ability to send

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.155
your marketing emails to try and convert you into a paying customer.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:58.370
If you provide your email or any other piece of information about yourself,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.310
you have indicated interest in the business,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.360
and the business will now think of you as a potential customer.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.685
They call this a lead.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.625
Other ways that businesses gauge your interests

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:14.165
are if you download a document or create an account.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:17.390
Once visitors engage in any of these actions,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.925
the user is counted as a lead.

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.960
At this level, marketing teams often want to know how much

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.965
it costs a business to get the viewers to get to this level.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:32.375
The metric we calculate is the cost per lead.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.435
The final step is when the customer actually

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:38.855
makes a purchase and becomes a paid customer.

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:43.085
In other words, the lead converted to a paid customer.

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:48.800
Our ultimate goal is to maximize these conversions at the bottom of the funnel.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.300
In the following pages,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.590
we will address each of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.660
these specific metrics that capture the progress at each of these levels.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.210
We will go over how to calculate them,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.010
and then you will practice.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.880
Now that you have an overview of this customer journey,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.800
calculating these metrics is not going to be hard.
