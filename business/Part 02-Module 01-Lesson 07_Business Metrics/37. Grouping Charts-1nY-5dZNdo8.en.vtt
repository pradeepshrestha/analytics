00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Let's look at an example.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.110
Here is a line chart showing the average and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.190
median conversion rate across the year of 2016.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.830
As you can see from this line chart,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.035
the average conversion rate didn't seem to go above 0.35.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:22.455
That is 35 percent of our CRC turned into sale acquisitions on average.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:27.480
However, if you slice the data by regions,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.895
you see that the story is much more interesting.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.315
In fact, the Eastcoast region was able to demonstrate

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:37.800
a higher conversion rate than 0.35, close to 0.6.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.140
You may even choose to contrast and compare the strategies used by

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.020
the sales team in the Eastcoast region and apply those lessons to the other regions.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.425
Perhaps, they did some [inaudible] test that worked better,

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.820
and they can be adopted in other regions,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.740
such as the Southwest region.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.480
Or you may find that it is a matter of cities within the eastern coast region,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.520
and the urban locations or high density of grocery stores in urban locations,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.415
food preferences of customers.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:12.120
All of these factors may be contributing to these differences.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.980
But you can only arrive at these decisions if you slice the data and look at the details.
