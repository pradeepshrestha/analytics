00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.345
This far, we've been focusing on the conversion metrics within a marketing metrics.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.770
However, you can also capture the impact of marketing campaign in

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.360
terms of revenue using metrics that capture the financial cost.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.905
These include cost per acquisition and lifetime values.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.860
Let's tackle cost per acquisition first.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.605
Before we get started,

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.930
acquisition refers to a non-paying customer.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.620
Cost per acquisition focuses on the sales and marketing costs including cost of supplies,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.120
labor and marketing, overhead,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.800
and sales that it took to convert a non paying customer into a paying customer.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.860
You calculated by dividing the marketing and sales cost by the number of newly customers.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.430
If you're feeling confused about CPA and CAC at this point,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.680
don't worry, it confused me too.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.185
Let's go over the difference between these.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.529
CPA is focused on the marketing and sales cost,

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:09.425
so it includes overhead and salaries for staff in addition to marketing and sales costs.

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:13.210
CPA also focuses on sales leads,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.920
not actual paying customers.
