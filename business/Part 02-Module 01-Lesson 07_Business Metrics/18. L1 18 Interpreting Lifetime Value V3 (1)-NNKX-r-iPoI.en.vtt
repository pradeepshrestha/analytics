00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
One thing business analysts

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.630
sometimes rip up on are the assumptions they make about the data.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.445
Let's go back to our WeCart company.

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:15.375
Say you're the business analysts,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.310
calculating the LTV across the years,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.725
and you're counting the number of transactions by converted customers during each year.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:28.915
For example, you want to know the LTV for a customer acquired in 2016.

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:34.645
You want to include all the transactions the customer had even those in 2017.

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:37.930
LTV takes into account future uncertainty.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.620
It is a good estimate about the future actions of the customer.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.550
Another thing to keep in mind is the actual value of the product.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.320
Most high value products,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.300
such as a car or a house,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.295
won't have customers coming back and buying it again and again.

00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:58.540
For example, it's very likely you have bought cars from different dealerships.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.980
So, for the dealership,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.660
it is more important to focus on

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.085
the individual customer value rather than the lifetime value.

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:09.520
The value you provide each dealership is restricted to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.510
that single purchase you made because you never visit them again.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.865
Compare that to smaller orders at Amazon.

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:20.350
There, the lifetime value will make sense as

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.000
you're likely to come back and make orders several times.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.680
Calculating lifetime value matters in this case.
