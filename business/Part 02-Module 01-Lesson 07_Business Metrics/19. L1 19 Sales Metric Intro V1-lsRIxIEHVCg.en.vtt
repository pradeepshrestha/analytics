00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.640
Sales metrics borrow some terminology from marketing metrics.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.650
Sales can not only focus on the end customer such as the consumer,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.025
but also a company who will likely generate customers.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.604
In the case of We Card from marketing,

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:22.650
we have thus far focused on the end consumer,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.620
and their order as our marketing focus,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.540
or unit of analysis.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.810
This type of model is called a business to consumer model or B2C.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.900
Let's say that we add an additional focus on

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.605
generating sales by reaching out to grocery stores.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:45.080
This is where We Card partners with the local grocery stores.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.775
We can now gain access to

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:51.530
their customers and the local grocery stores can access a delivery service.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.075
This type of business model is called a business to business model or B2B.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:02.345
So, part of our sales team can focus on the B2B model,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.455
where each sales rep is trying to create a sales lead.

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:11.180
A sales lead would be a grocery store interested in partnering with We Card.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.970
If a grocery stores signs a deal,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.510
then it becomes a booking or a closed deal.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.600
We will talk about a sales funnel, next.
