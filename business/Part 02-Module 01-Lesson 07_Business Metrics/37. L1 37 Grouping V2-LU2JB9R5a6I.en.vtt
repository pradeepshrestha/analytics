00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
A very important role

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.515
of a business analyst is to look at the data from normally one perspective,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.790
but to look at the numbers after dividing the data between subgroups.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.640
A common mistake people make is to look at

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.940
the mean and base their decisions on that alone.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.325
More informed recommendations are based on detailed analysis of the data distribution.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.680
Then, what is captured in the mean?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.175
The phrase, devil is in the detail, is handy here.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:36.110
For example, your market segments may be split across states,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.690
regions, or even countries.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.545
Always look at the data across these groups or

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:45.140
other categories to let the data tell you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.395
what is working for one group and not the other.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.290
This type of grouping will affect how you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.665
interpret all of the metrics we have covered so far.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:57.560
Let's look at an example next.
