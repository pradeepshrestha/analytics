Congratulations, you've completed this lesson on business metrics.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:14.460
You've learned wide range of business metrics used across a gamut of business functions,

including marketing, sales, growth, and finance.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.620
You not only learn about how to calculate each of these metrics,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.075
but have also gained a good understanding of how the business processes work.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:30.480
This broad understanding of the business contexts will come in

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.035
very handy as you work in a business analyst role.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:38.364
Based on the type of business function on which you focus your analysis,

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:41.510
you can now choose which key performance metrics

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.095
will help you answer important questions for your business.

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:51.050
You also know how to present your findings to your stakeholders through visualizations.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.815
This will help them make sense of the data and make informed decisions based on the data.

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.490
Remember, if any of these topics caught your interests,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.755
you should definitely explore these fields further.

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
