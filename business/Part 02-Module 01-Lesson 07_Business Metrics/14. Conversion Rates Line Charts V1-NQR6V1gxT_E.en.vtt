00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
I wanted to share out this visualization for depicting the conversion rates that can

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.010
be very helpful for business analysts to depict

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.100
the data on conversion rates to their stakeholders.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.980
This is a line chart showing the time

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.340
on the X-axis and the conversion rate on the Y-axis.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.870
And this is a particularly useful tool when you want to engage the stakeholders,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.310
such as the executive team,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490
around what the conversion rate data is telling us.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.930
So, line charts like this can allow you to indicate how specific customer,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.400
facing tools, and methods,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.380
such as email marketing campaigns,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.605
website features are showing higher success rate in converting leads to paying customers.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.930
And this type of visualization allows the marketing and growth team to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.050
identify these successful tools and campaigns or failed ones as well,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.530
and plan future efforts to maximize conversions.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.330
So, this is a useful tool to have in your toolkit as well.
