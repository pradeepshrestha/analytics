00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.405
Marketing is about how and where you get the word out about your product.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.150
Traditionally, this used to be about choosing to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.615
advertise in the newspaper, radio, or TV.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.385
But now, with the internet,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.380
the possibilities are endless.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.414
Companies can use social media like Instagram, Twitter,

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:29.715
Facebook, Google Search, LinkedIn or even blogs to advertise their product.

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.970
Online marketing gives you one advantage.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.395
With the use of cookies,

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:39.945
a customer's journey can be tracked across time and across platforms.

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:43.940
Knowing about the customers path can help companies figure

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.160
out places for targeting these and similar customers.
