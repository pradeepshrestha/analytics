00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
So, which KPI should be used as a business analyst?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.995
Well, that really depends on what question is being asked.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.510
As a business analyst,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.880
you're tasked with gathering appropriate information to help you solve business problems.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.920
You have to identify what needs to change and communicate the information in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.530
clear manageable chunks of data to allow you to move towards a solution.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.430
There are specific steps you take to address the question.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.675
First, you need to think about the business goal or objective you're trying to meet,

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:43.760
this will guide the type of data you need to collect and the KPIs you will track.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.880
Next, you actually do the data analysis and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.290
calculate the appropriate business metric on your data.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.005
Then, you use the results of your analysis to identify

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.520
a solution or a strategy that will meet the original business goal.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.960
Finally, your present the metrics and visualizations to help

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.200
you convey your findings in a digestible way to the stakeholders.
