00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
So, to calculate the lifetime value,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.630
let's use this formula.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.260
We're going to go ahead and break each piece up,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.095
so that we can see how to calculate each of these components of the formula,

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.270
and we're going to use the week r example again.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.620
Let's assume a typical week our customer orders groceries once a week,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.975
for say $70 per order.

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.875
So, our purchase cycle we can make it to be one week,

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.310
total sales revenue per cycle would be the $70 we

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.375
expect to earn from the customer during this purchase cycle,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.965
to 70, and then the number of sales per

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:38.530
purchase cycle would be the number of times the customer buys during the purchase cycle,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.690
which would be one order per week.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.550
So, one order per customer cycle, which is one.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.725
Now, let's go ahead and calculate the other pieces of the formula.

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.220
To calculate the other two pieces of the formula,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.560
you need to take into account cost per acquisition as well as average sales revenue.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.670
So, let's walk through these.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.005
So, the cost per acquisition is the CPR that we've calculated before.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.720
So, let's assume this to be $25.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.875
So, it takes about $25 of sales and marketing costs to get a need.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:11.239
The expected retention time is the amount of time

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:15.980
which is measured in purchase cycles that you expect to retain the customer.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.630
I think we can aim a customer to stay with our business for, say seven years,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.430
when she say, think of our own experience as a grocery buyer and online shopper.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.390
So, this would be seven years,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.840
but since we need this in the purchase cycles as that is our unit.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.420
So, we're going to go seven years times 52.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.890
So, that's how I got this.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.580
So, this would be seven times 52 weeks per year,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.675
so that gives us 364 weeks across seven years.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:48.575
Average sales revenue is the average revenue we

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:53.830
receive from the customer per transaction during the cycle.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.320
We calculate this above.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380
This is $70 per cycle,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.060
so that's 70 here,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.695
and then profit margin per customer.

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:06.470
The way to calculate this is average sale,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.850
which is $70 minus the average cost of sales.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.820
So, this would be where you can plug in the cost per acquisition,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.770
so over the average sales.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.680
So, this would be this minus this over 70.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.980
Okay. So, that's $0.64 on a dollar.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.230
That's the profit margin per customer.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.370
Now, we're ready to plug all of that in into the lifetime value formula.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.075
So, we're ready to plug in the values for the lifetime value now.

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:38.675
So, this is going to be our average sale,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:44.090
which is 70 times number for peak sales,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.140
which is one times expected retention time,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.515
which is these number of weeks across seven years times the profit margin.

00:02:54.515 --> 00:03:00.835
So, 16,380 or the value that a customer would bring to a company.

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:06.200
So, now that you know that an average customer value is 16,380,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.255
the company should spend less than this to obtain a new paying customer.

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:12.960
It is spending more than this,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.130
the company may be making losses in the long run.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.705
One other thing, I have seen several equations for lifetime value.

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:25.895
It is generally recommended to calculate lifetime value using a few different ways,

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.750
so you can get a better estimate of your average lifetime value.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.020
We've provided a few links below for you to

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.000
see what are the other ways to calculate lifetime value of a customer.
