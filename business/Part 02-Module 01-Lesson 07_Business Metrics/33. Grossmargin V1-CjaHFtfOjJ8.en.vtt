00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
A gross margin is your revenue in sales minus cost of goods sold over your sales revenue.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.020
Or, in other words, it's your gross profit over your sales revenue.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.075
This is how you get it.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.795
You take your gross profit and divide it

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:22.105
by the total revenue and if you want the same value in percentage,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.580
you just multiply that by a 100.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.220
We have a relatively high gross margin.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.845
You can see, even as you eyeball the sales revenue compared to the cost of goods sold,

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.025
this gross margin tells if you got executives.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:40.295
The 46% of the sales revenue or 46 cents over

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:46.010
each sales revenue dollar is available to cover operating expenses.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.995
If the cost of goods increases,

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:55.000
or the revenue declines and the margin begins to decline over time,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.610
the company has less money to cover those expenses.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.250
So, how do you know if this is a good gross margin?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.159
A good gauge is to look at industry standards or financial statements,

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.830
or reports shared by other top competitors and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.015
see whether your gross margin falls below or above the industry standard.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.360
It can tell you a lot about how you're doing in

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.985
terms of sales or pricing of your product,

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:23.730
expenses, and if you need to lower your expenses.
