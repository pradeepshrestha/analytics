00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Contribution margin allows us to calculate

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.570
the profitability of our product even at the unit level.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.850
It is based on the number of units that are being sold.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.565
Remember, not the number of orders.

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:16.780
To calculate the contribution margin,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.255
we take the difference between the revenue and the variable costs.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.055
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:28.065
So this is just the difference between the revenue and the variable costs.

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.125
If you want the contribution margin at the unit level,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:34.980
you just divide that difference by the number of goods sold.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.930
So, let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.975
So that would be total revenue minus variable cost over number of goods sold.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:48.675
So this tells you per unit sold how much is the contribution margin.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:53.660
In this example, we can see that the contribution margin is less than three dollars.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.020
To pay for overhead costs,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.160
we need to get as close as possible to this to $2.94 magic number to break even.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.395
This can even help in making decisions about allocating limited resources,

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:13.430
directing the funds to more profitable product lines.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.420
For example, a grocery store like Target would typically have

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.840
a low contribution margin because it works with large quantity of types of products.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.780
So they can make up their profits for

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.045
the share quantity of their sales across a wide range of products.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.720
In other words, if one product has low contribution margin,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.160
another has a higher contribution margin,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.775
and that way they can make up for any loss on the item with the low contribution margin.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:43.730
On the other hand, imagine an online store that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.095
only sells very high-end fashion products.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:51.395
They, on the other hand, will have a high contribution margin per item

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:56.330
as they have fewer sales in comparison to the products being sold at Target.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.770
So this online fashion store needs to make sure each sale counts.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.870
So that is the broad idea of contribution margin.
