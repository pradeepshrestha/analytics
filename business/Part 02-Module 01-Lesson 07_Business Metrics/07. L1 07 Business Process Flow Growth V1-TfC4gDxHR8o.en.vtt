00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.720
Let's take the case of WeCar to broadly think about the business question of growth.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.375
To grow the business, we got executives,

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.030
would be interested in growing the customer base.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.210
But, growing it can occur in two ways.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.185
The first is to get new customers to increase the customer base.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.840
The second way is to get current customers to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.155
increase the order size or make repeated orders.

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:29.880
So, as business analyst,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.790
you need to break down the question of business growth to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.640
explore how we can quantify or measure the answer.
