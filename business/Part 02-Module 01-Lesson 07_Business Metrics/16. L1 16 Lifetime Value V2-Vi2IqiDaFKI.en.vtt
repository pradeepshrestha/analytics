00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
When you decide how to spend your marketing budget,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290
you want to focus on some of your best customers,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.485
customers who will stay with you for the long-term,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.180
who will continue to generate revenue for the company longer than say,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
a customer who finds a cheaper deal somewhere else and leaves your website.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.850
In other words, you want to identify your high-value customer,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.330
so that you can focus on bringing in more of these customers.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
Think of it this way: Your goal is for every dollar you spend on

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
your marketing efforts to give you a higher rate of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.300
return and generate revenue multiple times over.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.250
How do you go about doing that?

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.990
You use a business metric called lifetime value of a customer.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.285
To calculate lifetime value,

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.685
let's cover a few key concepts.

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:58.730
Again, make sure you make a note of the terminology and definitions.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.844
They are going to get slightly complicated,

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:03.730
but we will walk through each of them one by one.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.390
So, keep in mind we want to be able to estimate how much revenue we can expect

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.160
to earn per customer as far into the future as we can.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.610
To calculate this, we need to take into account a lot of

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.645
different metrics and data to create a single LTV metric.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:25.520
First, purchase cycle is a time period that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.175
depicts the general frequency with which your products are purchased.

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:35.330
At Udacity, if we start a new nano degree class every two weeks,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.685
two weeks would be the purchase cycle.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:41.240
Total sales revenue per cycle is the revenue

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.295
earned from all customers per purchase cycle.

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:49.130
Number of sales per purchase cycle is the number of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
times your average customer buys during the purchase cycle.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.160
Cost per acquisition, you've seen this before.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.545
It's a total cost of marketing and sales divided by the number of new leads.

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:06.430
With me this far, feel free to pause the video or [inaudible] ,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.315
review, and think about what I've said this far.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:14.005
Next, we have expectation retention time.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.545
This is the amount of time you expect to retain the customer.

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:20.455
This is measured in terms of purchase cycles,

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:22.980
what we covered right at the top of this list.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.785
So, if we expect a customer to be retained for a year given a two-week purchase cycle,

00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:33.445
then we have an ERT of about 26.

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:37.760
Average sales revenue is the revenue you earn from

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
the average customer per transaction during the cycle.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.840
This is the total customer revenue divided by the number of purchases in the cycle.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.955
Profit margin per customer is the percentage of sales that has turned into profits.

00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:01.685
Again, feel free to pause the video here and process what I've covered this far.

00:03:01.685 --> 00:03:04.930
Next, we have one last thing to do,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.280
calculate the lifetime value.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.600
Lifetime value is the average sale times the number of

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.305
repeated sales times expected retention time times profit margin.

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.950
Essentially, this is the net profit you can attribute to

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.810
the customer over the length of their relationship with the company.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.360
Let's do this in Excel in the next video.
