00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.190
The sales funnel also called the sales pipeline,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.640
tracks the number of incoming leads or prospects.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.100
These are leads that a sales team member has

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.790
identified as being potentially interested in the product.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.575
Then, the sales team member follows up for an interested lead to

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:27.480
ask more about what they're looking for, possibly making presentations.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.530
Here, you track metrics like number of sales leads.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.090
This is followed by a qualifying process whereas the sales team qualifies the leads.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.345
Checks to see if the product offering is within the leads budget,

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.755
a sort of vetting,

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:47.075
to identify the ideal buyer and confirm their viable lead.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.935
Here, you track metrics like ratio of qualified leads to sales leads.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.860
Once the sales team has a qualified lead,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.665
you end with a closed deal or booking.

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:02.180
At this stage, you can also have a lead on hold or last.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.985
Here, you track metrics like bookings,

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:09.125
close ratio, and average size of deal in pipeline.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:14.405
Bookings is a very important metric for tracking the success of the sales team.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:19.250
Close ratio is the ratio of closed deals to leads,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.415
you had in the sales pipeline.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.250
As you may have noticed,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.520
sales metrics are measuring the performance of the sales team internal to the company.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.265
As oppose to tracking the behavior of individual customers in the marketing metrics.

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:38.045
For this lesson, we will cover the metrics at the bottom of the funnel.

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:40.820
But we have provided links and resources

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.680
below for you to learn more about the others if you're interested.
