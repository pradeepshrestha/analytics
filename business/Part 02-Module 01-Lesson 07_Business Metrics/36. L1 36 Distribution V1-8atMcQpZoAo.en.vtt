00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.800
In the earlier lessons, you learned about measures of

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.485
central tendency and measures of spread.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.000
As a business analyst,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.390
you should make sure to apply these statistical tools as

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.245
you generate and examine the data using business metrics.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.620
A business metric is one data point that in

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.355
itself does not tell much about the larger context.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.395
Much like other things in life,

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:33.540
data makes more sense and has more value if it is looked at within a context.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.550
So, as a business analyst,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.490
your data analysis process should include

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.020
exploratory checks to examine the spread of the data.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.875
You should always be asking and checking to see if the data is spread out equally in

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:51.100
each direction and to see if the shape of

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.315
the distribution resembles a normal distribution or not.

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:58.990
This is important, because you need to know if

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.020
what you're seeing is expected or out of the ordinary.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.845
In the previous lesson,

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.025
we talked about skewness and we come back to it in this lesson.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:12.160
The box plot or histogram as you may

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.135
remember are useful tools that tell you about skewness.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.525
They can alert you to any skewness in the data.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:23.455
Another way to check for skewness is to compare the mean

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:27.755
and median values to see if they are more or less the same.

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:31.970
Creating visualizations to look at data distributions and computing

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.030
multiple summary statistics like mean and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.840
median should be a reflexive habit of a business analyst.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.000
Let's look at an example to understand why this is important.
