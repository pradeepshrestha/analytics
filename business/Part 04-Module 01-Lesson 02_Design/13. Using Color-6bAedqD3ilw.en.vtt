00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Color is an important tool in designing visualizations.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:09.355
It allows you to encode another variable or split your data into groups.

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:11.460
However, there are a lot of issues you need to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.520
consider when choosing which colors to use and how to apply them.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.728
As an example of the power of color,

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:22.440
consider these two plots of GDP versus life expectancy.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.500
Look how much more information adding color provided.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
We got the idea that higher GDPs correlate with higher life expectancy, however,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.960
by adding color, the region of the countries belong to is now more apparent.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.860
We can see how the countries are distributed in the world in this plot.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.270
The low GDP countries are almost all in sub-saharan Africa.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.803
And on the high end,

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:48.085
you see Europe and North America.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:52.470
The orange in between is the former Soviet states.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.230
Color is an important tool in visualizations,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
and it's important to use it appropriately to have the largest impact.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.385
Consider this bar chart.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.590
Overall, I would say that color distracts from the data.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.715
The colors shown don't appear to be chosen for any particular reason.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.070
In fact, they're are actually the default for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
the software in which this plot was built, rainbow colors.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.510
These colors are also quite bright which strains the eyes.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.795
Above all, each color doesn't actually convey any additional information about the data.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.480
The labels on the left side of the bar plot are enough to

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.350
indicate which bar belongs to which type of diamonds cut.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.200
This actually makes the use of color redundant since

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
both the labels and the color are indicating the cut type.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.690
You might also have noticed that the legend at the right is unnecessary.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.190
We could simply design this visualization with the labels at the left of the graph,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.900
decreasing the amount of time

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.530
the reader's eye jump between the wedge in and the main data display.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.350
Here are my three main tips for using color and plot.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.825
My first piece of advice comes from the design field.

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.370
Get it right in black and white.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.704
Before you begin adding color to your data visualization,

00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:08.844
you should determine if you need color in the first place.

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:11.310
Many times, black, white and shades of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.800
grey will be enough to effectively convey your information.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.375
Secondly, if you are going to use color,

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:24.090
consider using less intense colors such as natural colors or pastels.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.496
You can also add some gray value to bright colors to make them less vibrant.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:30.780
Colors with higher gray values have

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610
a softer feel and the eye can concentrate on them for longer periods of time.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.220
Rainbow colors, primary colors and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.505
other bright bold colors create noisy visualizations that strain the eye.

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:48.410
My final tip is to make color selections that facilitate communication.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.510
In this example, I used a complimentary color to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.150
draw attention to the count of ideal cut diamonds.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.480
You could use a similar strategy if you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.355
want to highlight particular data points in a graphic.

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:01.500
Perhaps you've come across

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
some good and not so good examples of color use in visualizations.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.455
Color can be a tricky component of a visualization but can also encode data,

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:15.000
lead the eye, and help viewers see the most important information of a graphic.
