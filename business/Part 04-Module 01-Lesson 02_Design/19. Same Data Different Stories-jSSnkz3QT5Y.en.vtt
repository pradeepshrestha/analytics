00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.500
Database Scene one, take one.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.641
Here is a bar chart providing the likely places you lost your remote control.

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:12.839
You can see that the most likely place you will find the remote,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.769
is actually in your hand.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.289
While the least likely is that it's gone forever and you'll never find it.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.375
Other options for where your remote might be,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.914
are shown here in descending order.

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:27.719
Let's try again. Database scene one take two.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:34.750
Have you ever been looking for a hat and find out that you're already wearing it?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.229
Or looking for your keys and find out they're in your back pocket?

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.429
Or looking for your backpack and you find out that it's on your back?

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.774
Turns out losing your remote is the same problem.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:49.795
This chart highlights the seven places your remote is likely to be.

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.554
The top place, is in your hand.

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:56.350
The least likely place that it is, is lost forever.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.996
But before you think you were one of those two people,

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:01.164
make sure you check under the couch,

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:03.625
next to the TV, in the fridge,

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.189
in your shirt pocket and under the rug.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.724
Before you blame the dog for eating your remote,

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:13.164
or think an alien came from space and stole your remote, check your hand.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.520
It's unlikely your remote is gone forever.
